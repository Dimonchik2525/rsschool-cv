# About Me
I have been learning frontend development for over two years.
I learned everything through free YouTube courses and books, spending many hours practicing what I learned.
I have created many apps, both using templates and on my own.
Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find freelance work yet, and I hope that RSS School will help me get the skills I’m missing.
My main goal is to leave my current job and become a frontend developer.
